cmg539_proxy.py

This program runs with the command "python3 cmg539_proxy.py --port <port num>"

I removed all the comments that were included in the original starter file.
All comments included are my own.

The program, rudimentarily:

-creates a socket and corresponding threads for connections
  -parses the data from the request for each thread, sorts into dictionary and appropriate variables
  -checks if data is formatted incorrectly
  -checks if the request type is "GET"
  -creates new socket, connects to given hostname, completes request
  -closes new socket
-closes the socket
