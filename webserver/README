cmg539_webserver.py

This program runs with the command "python3 cmg539_webserver.py --port <port num>"

I removed all the comments that were included in the original starter file.
All comments included are my own.

The program, rudimentarily:

-creates a socket
-binds it to the port (command line argument)
-handles the request string
  -parses the data from the request, sorts into dictionary and appropriate variables
  -checks if data is formatted incorrectly
  -checks if the request type is "GET"
  -finds and opens the file path if able, uploads
-closes the socket
